# MathWorks-Math-Modelling-Challenge-2019

## General Information
Data collecting and analyzing was split across the entire team. I primarily focused on the LaTeX.
The 2019 team from Wayne Hills High School consisted of:
1. Elijah Paul
2. Michael Ferreira
3. Jacob Park
4. Jordan Leong
5. Jordan Wang

Otherwise known as Team #12629.

## What is M3 Challenge?
MathWorks Math Modeling (M3) Challenge is a contest for high school juniors and seniors. Through participation, students experience what it’s like to work as a team to tackle a real-world problem under time and resource constraints, akin to those faced by professional mathematicians working in industry. Extra credits awards are available for teams who choose to write or employ outstanding code as part of their solution. The Challenge awards $100,000 and has a time limit of 14 hours.

## The 2019 Problem
Quickly adapted from https://m3challenge.siam.org/archives/2019/problem. 

1. **Darth Vapor**—Often containing high doses of nicotine, vaping (inhalation of an aerosol created by vaporizing a liquid) is hooking a new generation that might otherwise have chosen not to use tobacco products. Build a mathematical model that predicts the spread of nicotine use due to vaping over the next 10 years. Analyze how the growth of this new form of nicotine use compares to that of cigarettes. \
 
2. **Above or Under the Influence?**—Like nicotine, the abuse of most substances is correlated with numerous internal and external factors that affect the likelihood of an individual becoming addicted. Create a model that simulates the likelihood that a given individual will use a given substance. Take into account social influence and characteristic traits (e.g., social circles, genetics, health issues, income level, and/or any other relevant factors) as well as characteristics of the drug itself. Demonstrate how your model works by predicting how many students among a class of 300 high school seniors with varying characteristics will use the following substances: nicotine, marijuana, alcohol, and unprescribed opioids. 
 
3. **Ripples**—Develop a robust metric for the impact of substance use. Take into account both financial and non-financial factors, and use your metric to rank the substances mentioned in question #2. 

**Your submission should include a one-page executive summary with your findings, followed by your solution paper—for a maximum of 20 pages. If you choose to write code as part of your work to be eligible for the technical computing prize, please include it as an appendix. Cite your sources, including those in the provided data files if you use them. Any code appendix or reference page(s) will not count toward your 20-page limit.**

## Our Response
Download the pdf named "Moody's 3.2.19" found above.

## Conclusions
We started an hour or two early which would have become really helpful towards the end when we were scrambling to put everything together, but overall it was a good first-time experience working and bonding together to provide answers for the prompts.
